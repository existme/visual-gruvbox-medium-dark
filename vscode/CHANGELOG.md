# Change Log
All notable changes to the "visual-gruvbox-medium-dark" extension are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- [ALL] 
    - I was not satisfy by the new beige color tone. Rollback to the "offcial" Gruvbox beige (#ebdbb2)
    - Operators keywords are now blue, they have to be constrated
    - Escape char is now blue
- [XML / HTML] Tags are now dark blue instead of blue, to look like more to the original VS dark theme. I thought XML and HTML tags and attributes were confusing (same blue). (On VS for Mac, they stay white, maybe a bug :s)
