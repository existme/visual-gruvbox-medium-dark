**Lot of changes happened during the "beta" due to some tests on "bad quality" screen.**
- [ALL] 
    - Operators keywords are now blue, they have to be contrasted
    - Escape chars are now blue
    - Change language punctuation color from grey to beige. On a Macbook screen it was nice but on a TN screen it was not very clear.
- [XML / HTML] attributes are now beige instead of blue, because they look like variables. I'll see if I keep this like that.
